            <h2>CALAGRY 1988: Looking back on Canada’s second Olympic Games</h2>
            <p>Montreal, home to the 1976 Olympic Games hosted 6084 athletes from 92 countries. This was the first time the Games touched down in Canada and it helped shape the landscape of Montreal.</p>

                <dd>Although Canada did not perform very well at its first home Games, Montreal 1976 has been noted for some major moments in history, touching on major global topics of the time and spawning personalities who still dominate the airwaves today:</dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>Twenty-two African countries boycotted to protest the fact that the New Zealand rugby team had toured apartheid South Africa and that New Zealand was scheduled to compete in the Olympic Games.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fourteen-year-old gymnast Nadia Comaneci of Romania was the first ever gymnast to receive a perfect 10 score.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bruce Jenner, later to be known as Caitlyn Jenner, won the gold in decathlon. This was Jenner’s second time at the Games, improving on a 10th place finish four years earlier and setting a new decathlon world record.
                    </li>
                    <p>Canada had a disappointing medal haul during 1976 with a total of 11 and no gold.
                        Canada won five silver medals and six bronze during the Games: eight in swimming, and one each in equestrian, athletics and canoe-kayak sprint.
                </ul>
