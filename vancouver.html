Eight cities applied to host the Games: Andorra la Vella (Andorra), Bern (Switzerland), Harbin (China), Jaca (Spain), PyeongChang (Republic of Korea), Salzburg (Austria), Sarajevo (Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Vancouver (Canada).</p>

                <li>Fourteen-year-old gymnast Nadia Comaneci of Romania was the first ever gymnast to receive a perfect 10 score.
                </li>
                <li>Bruce Jenner, later to be known as Caitlyn Jenner, won the gold in decathlon. This was Jenner’s second time at the Games, improving on a 10th place finish four years earlier and setting a new decathlon world record.
                </li>
                <p>Canada had a disappointing medal haul during 1976 with a total of 11 and no gold.
